# Cast tester

This file contains 3 unity scripts that allow the user to test and create code pretaining to box, circle, and ray casting.
in play mode you can edit the cast's settings and it will show you what that would look like in addition to there being buttons to simply copy the code
into your own scripts. There is a button to copy the funtionality code and the code for the visuals, including another button that gives you the same
code but with variables to make editing yourr script much easier.

If you are unsure of what a setting does then you can hover your mouse over the option in the inspector and a tooltip will pop up giving you a description.

Feel free to use this in any project, no need to credit!
hopefully this helps and I am very sorry if any part of it comese as confusing.

have fun making games! < 3
